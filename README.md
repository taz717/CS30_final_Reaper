# CS30-FinalProject-Reaper.exe

## Overview

![char](media/Main/RS.png)


This is the final project for CS30. It's a video game based
around a singular AI running through the same simulations over
 and over again until the director gets the ending he desires.

```
This is just a vertical slice currently due to use biting
way too much then we can chew (like usual). It will be 
copied over to github over the summer. The slice just uses
some sprites Taz put together with some basic sprite collisions
that Dhiraj created.
```

This program uses _python_ with _pygame_ as the engine we use to
compile the code. Other than pygame, we don't use any other
libraries. 

### How To Use
simply launch the game.

WAD for movement with W being a dash that has an invincibility
frame for hoping over enemies and other hurdles that the game
may toss at you in the future.

### sprites/Credits

Most of the sprites were made from scratch. The background
and door sprites were simply taken from 
[here](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-pixel-art)
and were modified from and with permission from the authors
